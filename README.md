# Class project for Principles of Web Design

Time spent: **24** hours spent in total

## Description

This is a website I made for one of my class projects. Since I am interested in e-commerce and web development I decided to start working on a example of a website for a small business like a liqour store. I built this website using HTML, CSS and PHP. The framework I used is Bootstrap. The database management system I used is MySQL. 

This is currently a project I consider to be still in progress. I will use it to test new things I learn about web development. 


## Video Walkthrough

Here's a walkthrough of how the website looks:

## Notes

While working on this project I advanced my knowledge in the follwing topics:  

1. Understanding of how to use Bootstrap to create responsive websites. 
2. How to structure modules so the code is clean and clear for other people who would like to review the source.
