            <h4>Macallan Rare Cask Single Barrel</h4>
            <p>The Macallan Rare Cask is comprised of whiskies drawn from 16      different Sherry cask styles, chosen by Macallan's Master Whisky Maker Bob Dalgarno. A high proportion of these casks are first fill, and has resulted in a rich, spicy Speyside single malt, bursting with honey'd raisin, root ginger and decadent chocolate notes.</p>

            <h4>Michter's - Straight Rye</h4>
            <p>Crazy-sweet aroma, full of caramel, vanilla and a slight floral touch. The bite comes first (and lingers awhile), followed by vanilla, caramel, coconut flavors. It mellows considerably with ice, and becomes quite likeable, drinkable and mild.</p>

            <h4>Ardbeg - Single Malt Scotch 10 Year Old Whisky</h4>
            <p>Jim Murray's 2008 World Whisky of the Year! When Ardbeg 10 was released it was the first expression from the distillery not to be chill-filtered. It's a true classic from Islay, and a must have for any fan of single malt whisky</p>

            <h4>Moniker - Pinot Noir 2012</h4>
            <p>A fantastic Pinot Noir that we love! A beautiful dark uit profile with interesting raspberry and forest floor aromatics. Fresh and well-made with flavors of earth, spice, pomegranate, raspberry, graham cracker, and American oak providing spice, toast, &amp; vanilla notes!</p>

            <h4>Au Bon Climat - Pinot Noir Santa Barbara County 2014</h4>
            <p>This wine is just easy to drink. Whether with fresh grilled salmon or left-over roast chicken or just in a glass by itself, the pretty plum and spring strawberry flavors of ABC SB Pinot are simply delicious. There is nothing pretentious here, just well balanced, nicely textured, brightly fruity wine that seems to go with everything.</p>

            <h4>Esporao Defesa Rose 2014</h4>
            <p>The grapes underwent pneumatic pressing after a short period of skin contact. Bright pink in color with berry aromas, the wine has flavors of raspberry, cherry and Victoria plum, with a hint of mint on the refreshing finish.</p>
