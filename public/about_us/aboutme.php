                <p>My name is Gregory Szymanski and I am the author of this website, which is a college project for one of my classes. The website represents an early stage design for a retail liqour store. I chose a retail business as a subject for my website because I have been regularly following business news and I have learned that we are now witnessing a huge change in how people search and buy products. Every year more people are buying all sorts of items online without leaving the comfort or their home. More people are also buying or at least searching for items they will buy later on their mobile devices and they spend less time in traditional brick and mortar stores. With such kind of trend all kinds of businesses have to adapt and adjust to consumer habits. This includes designing and creating websites that will attract customers and make it easy for them to purchase products. With less store traffic for many businesses a good website that will be responsive, easy to browse through, have a clean design, proper functionality and will be managed correctly is going to be the key to securing revenue and attracting future customers. E-commerce seems to be a very interesting industry that constantly changes and I find that to be very exciting.</p>

                <p>As an aspiring programmer and full stack developer I would like to work on e-commerce related projects and continue learning about making web applications. My dreams is one day to be able to help small and medium companies build websites that will positively affect their businesses. </p>
